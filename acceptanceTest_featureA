Acceptance Test for Feature A:
1. Initialize the application for sprint velocity calculation.
2. Invoke the method to input sprint points, simulating user input of "10", "15", "20", followed by "done" to signal completion.
3. Call the calculate_average_velocity method using the inputted sprint points.
4. Verify that the method correctly calculates and returns the average sprint velocity as 15.
5. Confirm that the application outputs "Average Sprint Velocity: 15" to the user.
6. The test passes if the output is as expected, covering the path of multiple methods being executed and interacted with.
