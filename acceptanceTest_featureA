Acceptance Test for Feature A:
1. Start the application which triggers the main method.
2. The main method calls input_sprint_points to collect sprint points from the user.
   - Simulate user input: "10", "15", "20", then "done" to finish the input process.
3. The input_sprint_points method processes the input and returns the list of sprint points.
4. The main method then calls calculate_average_velocity with the collected sprint points.
5. The calculate_average_velocity method calculates the average velocity and returns it.
6. The main method receives the average velocity and displays it to the user.
   - Verify the displayed average velocity is "15".
7. The test passes if all methods are executed in sequence and the final output is correct.
