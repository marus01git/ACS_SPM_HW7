Acceptance Test for Feature B:
1. Start the application which triggers the main method.
2. The main method prompts the user for the number of sprint days.
   - Simulate user input: "10" for the number of sprint days.
3. The main method then calls input_team_member_details to collect details for each team member.
   - Simulate user input for team member details:
     - Alice: PTO hours "8", Ceremony hours "2", Daily hours "8"
     - Bob: PTO hours "0", Ceremony hours "2", Daily hours "8"
     - Enter "done" to finish the input process.
4. The input_team_member_details method processes the input and returns the list of team member details.
5. The main method calls calculate_effort_hours with the collected team member details and sprint days.
6. The calculate_effort_hours method calculates the total and individual effort-hours and returns them.
7. The main method receives the effort-hour calculations and displays them to the user.
   - Verify the displayed total team effort-hours is "148".
   - Verify Alice has "70" available effort-hours and Bob has "78".
8. The test passes if all methods are executed in sequence and the final outputs are correct.
